ansible all --list-hosts   -- to view all hosts
ansible <host group> -m ping

to check hosts in a locally created hosts file we can use -i

ansible <hostgroup> -i hosts -m ping    --- this hosts is created in the current directory

ansible first look for its config file path in environment variable ANSIBLE_CONFIG and then in
current working directory and next it will look for user's home dir

set | grep ANSIBLE_CONFIG
export ANSIBLE_CONFIG= '''
